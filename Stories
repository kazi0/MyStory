One day a Anglo-Indian teacher named Mr OLiver was walikng down a path at around 6 pm in the evening.
he was late to his home so he thought of taking a shortcut through the dark and windy woods,
while he was walikng through the woods he saw a kid weeping in the dark beside a rock.
he went to kid slowly waliking and crushing the dried leaves on the ground he said to the kid "what are you doing 
here at this dark"
